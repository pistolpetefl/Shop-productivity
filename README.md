The purpose of this project is to create a functional DMS (Dealer management system) inspired by the DMS my place of employment uses as my first go at learning git, github, and Java. 

Predictably I'm starting by building the classes and functionality behind all of them, after that I'll implement some application logic to launch and run the program with user input, and eventually (not sure how long term this part is) will implement a GUI as I've never done that. 

This is totally a learn as I go process, I'm 3/4 through MOOC Java 2 after trying for years to get throgh it. I've decided I think I know enough to just start doing. I'm going to try to finish up MOOC, but right now it just can't keep my attention, and something is better than nothing. 

I intend to work on this completely solo until I have the first 2 of 3 steps complete, the back information and the application logic. After that I'll make the repo public to crowdsource some critiques, likely from reddit, and after making those changes move on to learning to build a GUI.

Good luck to me.
